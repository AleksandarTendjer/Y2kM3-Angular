            <h2> Welcome to my Space on the Web!</h2>
            <p>
                Hello there visitor! Welcome to my humble domain. You might have noticed the unique aesthetic of this site. It's a nod to the Y2K
                aesthetic, a time when the Internet was
                a lot more fun and whimsical. I've always loved that era of design, and I wanted my corner of the web to
                reflect that.<br />
            </p>
            <p>
                On this website, you'll find more information about my professional life and my little hobbies ! :)
            </p>

            <p>
                But that's enough about me for now. Take a look around, and feel free to reach out if you'd like to
                chat, collaborate,
                or just want to say hello!
            </p>
